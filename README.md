### About
busMSN provides device-agnostic bookmarkable live arrival estimates for [Madison Metro](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/) buses using the [SMSMyBus API](http://api.smsmybus.com/). It can be found at [busmsn.com](busmsn.com).

### Details
Because the same repository is used for pushing to Heroku and Github, the ````node_modules```` directory and ````Procfile```` are included. Additionally, in order to test locally you will need to procure an API key from [SMSMyBus](http://api.smsmybus.com/) and enter it into ````routes/apiKey.js````.

busMSN uses Grunt to validate HTML and minify CSS and Javascript. Make sure you have it installed if you would like to contribute (````npm install -g grunt-cli````).
